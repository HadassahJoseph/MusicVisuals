## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
We created an audio visual project we have created is an innovative & interactive multimedia  project created using java and the processing library


# Instructions
1. Press f5 to load the program. 
2. The song will start immediately on pressing f5.
3. To view the different visuals press number key 1-6.
4. To replay the song press the spacebar.

# How it works


# What I am most proud of in the assignment
Aisha: I am proud that I was able to make a visual that responds well to the amplitude of the song. My visual is the last one to be shown as the musics fades out my 3d spheres get smaller and look like stars.I take pride in the collaborative effort between my teammate and me. Together, we crafted a cohesive and innovative vision for our project. The synergy and open communication we maintained throughout the process allowed us to overcome challenges, brainstorm ideas, and ultimately bring our collective vision to life.

Molly:

Cecilia: 

Hadassah: I'm most proud of my half globe visual that fulfills our abstract theme. The visual captures the essence of the track, creating a mesmerizing and immersive experience for the viewer.I am proud of the abstract theme and the decision to incorporate the disco ball concept, as it aligns seamlessly with the overall vision of our work. By adhering to this theme, we were able to maintain a consistent aesthetic and effectively convey the mood and energy of the song through our visuals. I am especially proud of persevering through the obstacles we faced, such as rendering issues and difficulties with merging files on Git. Despite these setbacks, we remained determined and dedicated to producing a high-quality end result.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
